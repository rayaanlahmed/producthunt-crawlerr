Our database is built by aggregating signals and business data from multiple sources, including LinkedIn, company websites, public filings, funding announcements, hiring data, and news. That’s what allows our agents to prioritize leads showing real buying intent rather than just static directories.\n\nThat said, I want to be transparent: today, our coverage is strongest in broad B2B markets (SaaS, agencies, consultancies, tech, etc.). For niche verticals like perfumeries, boutique hotels, florists, and SPAs, we don’t yet have deep coverage in our database, though we’re expanding industry by industry.\n\nIn the meantime, you can upload your own contact lists (unlimited) and Nexuscale will still handle the research, enrichment, and personalized outreach for you. That way, your agents can actively work your exact target market while our broader database keeps growing.\n\nHope this helps clarify!\n\n—Kevin\n\nComment (6)\n\nShare\n\n##### Share Nexuscale AI\n\nHelpful?\n\n1\n\nLog in to join the conversation\n\n[Log in](https://appsumo.com/accounts/login/?next=/products/nexuscale/questions/database-leads-source-1424527/)\n\n[![OmbreDigital.co](https://appsumo2-cdn.appsumo.com/media/users/avatars/f57e20Od_f57e20_.png?width=150)OmbreDigital.co](https://appsumo.com/profile/OmbreDigital.co/)\n\nPosted: Sep 28, 2025\n\nKevin, slightly different audience, but same question.

Setup was quick and seamless, and within hours I was able to explore the platform, find relevant contacts, and even launch my first campaign. The interface is sleek and intuitive, making it easy to get productive right away.\n\nWhat impressed me most was the quality of the AI-driven outreach. Instead of generic templates, each email felt natural and personal, reflecting real context pulled from company signals. Add to that the continuous discovery of potential customers, and it quickly became clear how much time this tool can save. I also appreciate the option to approve campaigns before they go out, giving me full control over my outreach.\n\nSupport has been excellent. The chat team has been responsive and helpful whenever I’ve needed guidance, and Kevin, the CEO, personally took the time to answer my questions with clarity and vision. It’s rare to find leadership so directly engaged and a team so committed to their users.\n\nWhile there’s still room to grow with features like LinkedIn outreach and multi-workspaces, the foundation here is strong, and the pace of development is fast. I’m confident in the decision to use Nexuscale and excited to see how it continues to evolve.\n\nRead less\n\nFounder Team\n\n![Kevin_Nexuscale](https://appsumo2-cdn.appsumo.com/media/users/avatars/carousel.png?width=150)\n\nKevin\\_Nexuscale\n\nEdited Oct 1, 2025\n\nThank you for such a thoughtful and detailed review.

However, after using it for several weeks, my experience has been full of frustration. While Nexuscale offers innovative features, its execution is marred by persistent bugs, poor localization, and a lack of reliability. Here’s my detailed review.\n\n1\\. Credit System Chaos\n\nThe Problem: Nexuscale’s credit system is flawed. Uploading a CSV file of 60 leads deducted 60 credits from my account, even though I didn’t use the app’s target search tool. This happened repeatedly, forcing me to contact support for manual resets.\n\nWhy It Matters: Credits are a core part of Nexuscale’s pricing model. If you can’t trust the system to track usage accurately, you’ll constantly worry about running out of resources mid-campaign.\n\n2\\. Poor Database Coverage outside the U.S\n\nThe Problem: Nexuscale’s lead database is heavily skewed toward the U.S. When I filtered for New Zealand-based leads, the results were sparse and often irrelevant.\n\nWhy It Matters: If you’re targeting a niche or non-U.S. market, you’ll likely need to rely on your own lead lists.\n\n3\\. AI Uses Inappropriate News for Outreach\n\nThe Problem: One of the most concerning issues was the AI’s tendency to reference negative or irrelevant news about a prospect’s company in outreach emails. For example, it pulled in articles about lawsuits, safety concerns, or financial troubles and used them as conversation starters. This approach felt tone-deaf and unprofessional, especially when reaching out to potential clients. I had to manually review and rewrite every email to avoid sounding insensitive or out of touch.\n\nExample: The AI generated an email mentioning a recent lawsuit against a prospect’s company, framing it as a reason they needed my photo booth services for their staff party. Not only was this irrelevant, but it also risked offending the recipient.\n\nWhy It Matters: Using negative news in cold outreach can damage your credibility and relationship with prospects. The AI should focus on positive or neutral topics, or at least allow users to exclude certain types of content.\n\n4\\. Time Zone Mayhem\n\nThe Problem: Scheduled emails displayed inconsistent time zones, making it impossible to plan B2B outreach effectively.\n\nWhy It Matters: Sending cold emails at odd hours kills open rates. The lack of a clear time zone selector was a major oversight.\n\n5\\. Formatting and Deliverability Issues\n\nThe Problem: Emails sent via SMTP lost all formatting. Bullet points turned into jumbled text, signatures disappeared, and HTML elements (like logos) failed to render. The AI also insisted on using long dashes (—) mid-sentence, which looked unprofessional and increased spam risk.\n\nWhy It Matters: Poorly formatted emails hurt your brand’s credibility and deliverability.\n\n6\\. Missing Critical Features\n\nNo Logo Support in Signatures: The signature editor only supports text, so I couldn’t add my company logo. This was partly solved by adding HTML feature, but ending not showing on the emails sent anyway.\n\nLimited AI Customization: The AI ignored prompts to avoid certain phrases or formatting styles.\n\n7\\. Buggy CSV Imports\n\nThe Problem: Importing leads from CSV should be simple, but Nexuscale mislabeled fields. For example, it only allowed matching URLs to a “website” field (intended for personal sites), not company URLs.\n\nWhy It Matters: If you’re not using Nexuscale’s built-in lead search, you’re stuck with half-baked functionality.\n\n8\\. Test Emails That Never Arrived\n\nThe Problem: The “Send Test Email” feature failed repeatedly. I’d click the button, but nothing arrived in my inbox (or spam folder).\n\nWhy It Matters: Testing is critical before launching a campaign. Without it, you’re flying blind.\n\nAvoid It If:\n\nYou’re outside the U.S. or targeting niche markets.\n\nYou rely on cPanel or other non-Gmail/Outlook email providers.\n\nYou need reliable scheduling, formatting, or credit tracking.\n\nFinal Verdict: Wait for Improvements\n\nNexuscale has the potential to be a great tool, but it’s far from ready for prime time. Every single feature is either buggy or not working. Results can be disastrous if you start sending campaigns without checking the content and the formatting before hand. The interface is clean, and the support team is responsive, but the bugs and missing features make it feel like an, alpha product. Right now it is unusable, I’d recommend holding off until the development team irons out the kinks.\n\nEdit: True, they fixed things\n\nFew things tested after Kevin's comment:\n\nEmail sample:\n\n\"I saw the recent news about the troubling incident at a Brisbane Airbnb, which highlights the importance of safety and memorable experiences in hospitality. It reminds us how crucial it is to create positive, secure environments for guests and staff alike.\"\n\nTime, not fixed. only a few time zones, but some are incorrect\n\nEmail formatting not fixed, nor is the signature\n\nTest email not working\n\nRead less\n\nFounder Team\n\n![Kevin_Nexuscale](https://appsumo2-cdn.appsumo.com/media/users/avatars/carousel.png?width=150)\n\nKevin\\_Nexuscale\n\nSep 30, 2025\n\nHi Matt,\n\nWe read your extremely detailed review and thank you for your persistence, the time you spent with our support team was invaluable to our development over the last few weeks. Your unique setup (heavy CSV use, custom SMTP, wanting to complex formatting over cold emails, and international targeting) exposed critical conflicts that we needed to address immediately.\n\nWe are pleased to confirm that we took aggressive action, and the Nexuscale platform you log into today is vastly more stable than the version you reviewed.\n\nCritical Issues Resolved Based on Your Feedback\n\nWe have successfully addressed and resolved the core stability and trust issues you identified:\n\nAI Used Negative News: This was our most critical fix. We deployed an AI Sentiment Filter to exclude all negative company news, ensuring personalization is strictly positive or neutral.\n\nEmail Sending/Formatting: FIXED. We have optimized our system to better accommodate the varied configurations of self-hosted cPanel servers, resolving the bug that caused formatting and signatures to disappear. (Note: We still advise against using bullet points in cold emails, as they can independently increase spam risk.)\n\nCredit System Chaos: FIXED. The bug causing credits to be incorrectly consumed by CSV imports is resolved. Your credit tracking is now reliable.\n\nTime Zone Mayhem: FIXED. We completed the overhaul of our scheduling infrastructure to provide reliable, comprehensive global time zone support.\n\nData Importing (URLs): FIXED. We've had dedicated field for Company Website/URL to ensure the AI correctly reads and uses data from all your imported leads.\n\nMissing Kill Button & Merge Tags: FIXED. Both the \"Stop\" button(has been live for 2 weeks) for scheduled campaigns and the intermittent failure of the {{leads\\_first\\_name}} merge tag are resolved.\n\nTest Emails Never Arrived: FIXED. The \"Send Test Email\" feature is now stable and working as designed.\n\nWe understand why you felt the platform was unusable at the time of your review. We are confident we have rectified the issues exposed by your high-demand workflow. We’d genuinely appreciate it if you logged in to see the massive stability improvements firsthand.\n\nWarmly,\n\nThe Nexuscale Team\n\nHelpful?\n\n6\n\nShare\n\n##### Share Nexuscale AI\n\n[See detail](https://appsumo.com/products/nexuscale/reviews/only-useful-for-the-us-market-362411/)\n\n[![do57](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab46bbfa3020a0c21ec16fe2ca575b77?s=100&d=mm)](https://appsumo.com/profile/do57/)\n\n[![do57](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab46bbfa3020a0c21ec16fe2ca575b77?s=100&d=mm)do57](https://appsumo.com/profile/do57/)\n\n![Verified Purchaser badge](https://appsumo.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fappsumo2next-cdn.appsumo.com%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fverified-purchased-badge.248124e6.png&w=32&q=75)\n\nVerified purchaser\n\nMember since: Sep 2023Deals bought: 22\n\n![2 stars](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n![2 stars](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nPosted: Sep 30, 2025\n\nOnly useful for the US market?!\n\nI watched the videos and tried using it, but unfortunately, it seems pretty much unusable for the European (especially German) market, in my opinion.\n\nThe user interface is quite nice overall, so I’ll give it 2 tacos.\n\nFounder Team\n\n![Kevin_Nexuscale](https://appsumo2-cdn.appsumo.com/media/users/avatars/carousel.png?width=150)\n\nKevin\\_Nexuscale\n\nSep 30, 2025\n\nThanks for the honest review, 2 tacos noted 😄.

It can't use information that's not on LinkedIn's profile, so you can't scrap a database of clients outside LinkedIn and hiperpersonalize their emails with relevant information, because the AI doesn't take that into account.\n\nOh, and it doesn't write well in other languages that's not english (like spanish or catalan), it inserts english words on the text, which is very strange for an AI.\n\nAlso, there's certain bugs, like being unable to change the subject line while reviewing already created drafts... So I ended up using ChatGPT, creating everything individually before sending. They should also give you a system to personalize databases... since there's certain data that's not visible or customizable, which is a shame.\n\nThe only thing that is helping me is the automation of follow ups... This is the only reason I've not refunded yet... and their support is good, and they promise to solve these problems. So, it's an \"almost there\", 3/5. If they update and solve this, I will change my review. If they don't on 60 days and I find another big problem... I would refund tbh.\n\nRead less\n\nFounder Team\n\n![Kevin_Nexuscale](https://appsumo2-cdn.appsumo.com/media/users/avatars/carousel.png?width=150)\n\nKevin\\_Nexuscale\n\nSep 28, 2025\n\nThank you for sharing your detailed feedback.

Our database is built by aggregating signals and business data from multiple sources, including LinkedIn, company websites, public filings, funding announcements, hiring data, and news. That’s what allows our agents to prioritize leads showing real buying intent rather than just static directories.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">That said, I want to be transparent: today, our coverage is strongest in broad B2B markets (SaaS, agencies, consultancies, tech, etc.). For niche verticals like perfumeries, boutique hotels, florists, and SPAs, we don’t yet have deep coverage in our database, though we’re expanding industry by industry.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">In the meantime, you can upload your own contact lists (unlimited) and Nexuscale will still handle the research, enrichment, and personalized outreach for you. That way, your agents can actively work your exact target market while our broader database keeps growing.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Hope this helps clarify!</p><p

vary by specific role or company.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">French support: Job titles and company fields appear in French when available from the source data.</p><p

class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Verified email deliverability: Our average verified email deliverability in Canada is around 95%.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Filtering by company size &amp; location: You can filter by company size and we are adding a way that will let you filter by city or area.</p><p class=\"break-words

[word-break:break-word]\">From the moment I started using Nexuscale, I knew it was different. Setup was quick and seamless, and within hours I was able to explore the platform, find relevant contacts, and even launch my first campaign. The interface is sleek and intuitive, making it easy to get productive right away.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">What impressed me most was the quality of the AI-driven outreach. Instead of generic templates, each email felt natural and personal, reflecting real context pulled from company signals. Add to that the continuous discovery of potential customers, and it quickly became clear how much time this tool can save. I also appreciate the option to approve campaigns before they go out, giving me full control over my outreach.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Support has been excellent. The chat team has been responsive and helpful whenever I’ve needed guidance, and Kevin, the CEO, personally took the time to answer my questions with clarity and vision. It’s rare to find leadership so directly engaged and a team so committed to their users.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">While there’s still room to grow with features like LinkedIn outreach and multi-workspaces, the foundation here is strong, and the pace of development is fast. I’m confident in the decision to use Nexuscale and excited to see how it continues to evolve.</p></div><button data-testid=\"toggle-cta\" type=\"button\" class=\"text-base font-normal text-bolt hover:underline\">Read less</button></div></div></div><div class=\"flex flex-col items-start gap-2 self-stretch rounded-lg  p-4 bg-sky-100\" data-testid=\"discussion-creator-reply\"><div class=\"flex w-full items-center justify-between gap-4\"><span class=\"text-xs font-semibold text-bolt\" data-testid=\"creator-reply-label\">Founder Team</span></div><div class=\"flex w-full items-center gap-2\"><div class=\"w-[calc(100%_-_55px)]\"><div class=\"flex flex-row items-center gap-x-2\"><img alt=\"Kevin_Nexuscale\" data-testid=\"creator-avatar\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" class=\"h-[24px] w-[24px] shrink-0 rounded-full object-cover\" src=\"https://appsumo2-cdn.appsumo.com/media/users/avatars/carousel.png?width=150\" style=\"color: transparent;\"><p class=\"-mb-1 truncate font-bold\" data-testid=\"creator-username\">Kevin_Nexuscale</p><span class=\"h-1.5 w-1.5 rounded-full bg-gravel\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span><span class=\"shrink-0 text-sm text-grace\" data-testid=\"creator-posted-date\">Edited Oct 1, 2025</span></div></div></div><div class=\"\"><div data-testid=\"toggle-text\" class=\"space-y-4\"><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Thank you for such a thoughtful and detailed review.

[word-break:break-word]\">When I discovered Nexuscale on AppSumo, I was excited by its promise of AI-driven email campaigns, CRM integration, and smart lead targeting. However, after using it for several weeks, my experience has been full of frustration. While Nexuscale offers innovative features, its execution is marred by persistent bugs, poor localization, and a lack of reliability. Here’s my detailed review.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">1. Credit System Chaos<br>The Problem: Nexuscale’s credit system is flawed. Uploading a CSV file of 60 leads deducted 60 credits from my account, even though I didn’t use the app’s target search tool. This happened repeatedly, forcing me to contact support for manual resets.<br>Why It Matters: Credits are a core part of Nexuscale’s pricing model. If you can’t trust the system to track usage accurately, you’ll constantly worry about running out of resources mid-campaign.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">2. Poor Database Coverage outside the U.S<br>The Problem: Nexuscale’s lead database is heavily skewed toward the U.S. When I filtered for New Zealand-based leads, the results were sparse and often irrelevant.<br>Why It Matters: If you’re targeting a niche or non-U.S. market, you’ll likely need to rely on your own lead lists.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">3. AI Uses Inappropriate News for Outreach<br>The Problem: One of the most concerning issues was the AI’s tendency to reference negative or irrelevant news about a prospect’s company in outreach emails. For example, it pulled in articles about lawsuits, safety concerns, or financial troubles and used them as conversation starters. This approach felt tone-deaf and unprofessional, especially when reaching out to potential clients. I had to manually review and rewrite every email to avoid sounding insensitive or out of touch.<br>Example: The AI generated an email mentioning a recent lawsuit against a prospect’s company, framing it as a reason they needed my photo booth services for their staff party. Not only was this irrelevant, but it also risked offending the recipient.<br>Why It Matters: Using negative news in cold outreach can damage your credibility and relationship with prospects. The AI should focus on positive or neutral topics, or at least allow users to exclude certain types of content.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">4. Time Zone Mayhem<br>The Problem: Scheduled emails displayed inconsistent time zones, making it impossible to plan B2B outreach effectively.<br>Why It Matters: Sending cold emails at odd hours kills open rates. The lack of a clear time zone selector was a major oversight.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">5. Formatting and Deliverability Issues<br>The Problem: Emails sent via SMTP lost all formatting. Bullet points turned into jumbled text, signatures disappeared, and HTML elements (like logos) failed to render. The AI also insisted on using long dashes (—) mid-sentence, which looked unprofessional and increased spam risk.<br>Why It Matters: Poorly formatted emails hurt your brand’s credibility and deliverability.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">6. Missing Critical Features<br>No Logo Support in Signatures: The signature editor only supports text, so I couldn’t add my company logo. This was partly solved by adding HTML feature, but ending not showing on the emails sent anyway.<br>Limited AI Customization: The AI ignored prompts to avoid certain phrases or formatting styles.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">7. Buggy CSV Imports<br>The Problem: Importing leads from CSV should be simple, but Nexuscale mislabeled fields. For example, it only allowed matching URLs to a “website” field (intended for personal sites), not company URLs.<br>Why It Matters: If you’re not using Nexuscale’s built-in lead search, you’re stuck with half-baked functionality.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">8. Test Emails That Never Arrived<br>The Problem: The “Send Test Email” feature failed repeatedly. I’d click the button, but nothing arrived in my inbox (or spam folder).<br>Why It Matters: Testing is critical before launching a campaign. Without it, you’re flying blind.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Avoid It If:<br>You’re outside the U.S. or targeting niche markets.<br>You rely on cPanel or other non-Gmail/Outlook email providers.<br>You need reliable scheduling, formatting, or credit tracking.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Final Verdict: Wait for Improvements<br>Nexuscale has the potential to be a great tool, but it’s far from ready for prime time. Every single feature is either buggy or not working. Results can be disastrous if you start sending campaigns without checking the content and the formatting before hand. The interface is clean, and the support team is responsive, but the bugs and missing features make it feel like an, alpha product. Right now it is unusable, I’d recommend holding off until the development team irons out the kinks.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Edit: True, they fixed things<br>Few things tested after Kevin's comment:<br>Email sample:<br>\"I saw the recent news about the troubling incident at a Brisbane Airbnb, which highlights the importance of safety and memorable experiences in hospitality. It reminds us how crucial it is to create positive, secure environments for guests and staff alike.\"</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Time, not fixed. only a few time zones, but some are incorrect<br>Email formatting not fixed, nor is the signature<br>Test email not working</p></div><button data-testid=\"toggle-cta\" type=\"button\" class=\"text-base font-normal text-bolt hover:underline\">Read less</button></div></div></div><div class=\"flex flex-col items-start gap-2 self-stretch rounded-lg  p-4 bg-sky-100\" data-testid=\"discussion-creator-reply\"><div class=\"flex w-full items-center justify-between gap-4\"><span class=\"text-xs font-semibold text-bolt\" data-testid=\"creator-reply-label\">Founder Team</span></div><div class=\"flex w-full items-center gap-2\"><div class=\"w-[calc(100%_-_55px)]\"><div class=\"flex flex-row items-center gap-x-2\"><img alt=\"Kevin_Nexuscale\" data-testid=\"creator-avatar\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" class=\"h-[24px] w-[24px] shrink-0 rounded-full object-cover\" src=\"https://appsumo2-cdn.appsumo.com/media/users/avatars/carousel.png?width=150\" style=\"color: transparent;\"><p class=\"-mb-1 truncate font-bold\" data-testid=\"creator-username\">Kevin_Nexuscale</p><span class=\"h-1.5 w-1.5 rounded-full bg-gravel\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span><span class=\"shrink-0 text-sm text-grace\" data-testid=\"creator-posted-date\">Sep 30, 2025</span></div></div></div><div class=\"\"><div data-testid=\"toggle-text\" class=\"space-y-4\"><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Hi Matt,</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">We read your extremely detailed review and thank you for your persistence, the time you spent with our support team was invaluable to our development over the last few weeks. Your unique setup (heavy CSV use, custom SMTP, wanting to complex formatting over cold emails, and international targeting) exposed critical conflicts that we needed to address immediately.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">We are pleased to confirm that we took aggressive action, and the Nexuscale platform you log into today is vastly more stable than the version you reviewed.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Critical Issues Resolved Based on Your Feedback<br>We have successfully addressed and resolved the core stability and trust issues you identified:</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">AI Used Negative News: This was our most critical fix. We deployed an AI Sentiment Filter to exclude all negative company news, ensuring personalization is strictly positive or neutral.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Email Sending/Formatting: FIXED. We have optimized our system to better accommodate the varied configurations of self-hosted cPanel servers, resolving the bug that caused formatting and signatures to disappear. (Note: We still advise against using bullet points in cold emails, as they can independently increase spam risk.)</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Credit System Chaos: FIXED. The bug causing credits to be incorrectly consumed by CSV imports is resolved. Your credit tracking is now reliable.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Time Zone Mayhem: FIXED. We completed the overhaul of our scheduling infrastructure to provide reliable, comprehensive global time zone support.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Data Importing (URLs): FIXED. We've had dedicated field for Company Website/URL to ensure the AI correctly reads and uses data from all your imported leads.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Missing Kill Button &amp; Merge Tags: FIXED. Both the \"Stop\" button(has been live for 2 weeks) for scheduled campaigns and the intermittent failure of the {{leads_first_name}} merge tag are resolved.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Test Emails Never Arrived: FIXED. The \"Send Test Email\" feature is now stable and working as designed.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">We understand why you felt the platform was unusable at the time of your review. We are confident we have rectified the issues exposed by your high-demand workflow. We’d genuinely appreciate it if you logged in to see the massive stability improvements firsthand.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Warmly,<br>The Nexuscale

had to manually do something the local AI should be doing automatically. It can't use information that's not on LinkedIn's profile, so you can't scrap a database of clients outside LinkedIn and hiperpersonalize their emails with relevant information, because the AI doesn't take that into account.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Oh, and it doesn't write well in other languages that's not english (like spanish or catalan), it inserts english words on the text, which is very strange for an AI.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Also, there's certain bugs, like being unable to change the subject line while reviewing already created drafts... So I ended up using ChatGPT, creating everything individually before sending. They should also give you a system to personalize databases... since there's certain data that's not visible or customizable, which is a shame.</p><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">The only thing that is helping me is the automation of follow ups... This is the only reason I've not refunded yet... and their support is good, and they promise to solve these problems. So, it's an \"almost there\", 3/5. If they update and solve this, I will change my review. If they don't on 60 days and I find another big problem... I would refund tbh.</p></div><button data-testid=\"toggle-cta\" type=\"button\" class=\"text-base font-normal text-bolt hover:underline\">Read less</button></div></div></div><div class=\"flex flex-col items-start gap-2 self-stretch rounded-lg  p-4 bg-sky-100\" data-testid=\"discussion-creator-reply\"><div class=\"flex w-full items-center justify-between gap-4\"><span class=\"text-xs font-semibold text-bolt\" data-testid=\"creator-reply-label\">Founder Team</span></div><div class=\"flex w-full items-center gap-2\"><div class=\"w-[calc(100%_-_55px)]\"><div class=\"flex flex-row items-center gap-x-2\"><img alt=\"Kevin_Nexuscale\" data-testid=\"creator-avatar\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" class=\"h-[24px] w-[24px] shrink-0 rounded-full object-cover\" src=\"https://appsumo2-cdn.appsumo.com/media/users/avatars/carousel.png?width=150\" style=\"color: transparent;\"><p class=\"-mb-1 truncate font-bold\" data-testid=\"creator-username\">Kevin_Nexuscale</p><span class=\"h-1.5 w-1.5 rounded-full bg-gravel\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span><span class=\"shrink-0 text-sm text-grace\" data-testid=\"creator-posted-date\">Sep 28, 2025</span></div></div></div><div class=\"\"><div data-testid=\"toggle-text\" class=\"space-y-4\"><p class=\"break-words [word-break:break-word]\">Thank you for sharing your detailed feedback.
